            <p>Injera is not only a kind of bread—it's also an eating utensil. In Ethiopia and Eritrea, this spongy,
                sour
                flatbread is used to scoop up meat and vegetable stews. Injera also lines the tray on which the stews
                are
                served, soaking up their juices as the meal progresses. When this edible tablecloth is eaten, the meal
                is
                officially over.</p>

        <div class="ingredients-steps">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup teff flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>a pinch of salt</li>
                <li>peanut or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>a mixing bowl</li>
                <li>a nonstick pan or cast-iron skillet</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the teff flour in the bottom of a mixing bowl, and sift in the all-purpose flour.</li>
                <li>Slowly add the water, stirring to avoid lumps.</li>
                <li>Put the batter aside for a day or more (up to three days) to allow it to ferment. In this time, your
                    injera batter will start to bubble and acquire the slight tanginess for which it's known. Note: If
                    you
                    find that your injera batter does not ferment on its own, try adding a teaspoon of yeast.</li>
                <li>Stir in the salt.</li>
                <li>Heat a nonstick pan or lightly oiled cast-iron skillet until a water drop dances on the surface.
                    Make
                    sure the surface of the pan is smooth: Otherwise, your injera might fall apart when you try to
                    remove
                    it.</li>
                <li>Coat the pan with a thin layer of batter. Injera should be thicker than a crêpe, but not as thick as
                    a
                    traditional pancake. It will rise slightly when it heats.</li>
                <li>Cook until holes appear on the surface of the bread. Once the surface is dry, remove the bread from
                    the
                    pan and let it cool.</li>
            </ol>
